Main Features of QField"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#3-working-with-qfield-in-an-archaeological-survey-and-archaeological-risk-assessment-projects","text":"<p>Until recently, paper maps were the only way of recording archaeological features and the fields\u2019 visibility in an archaeological survey work. Such data were digitised into a CAD or GIS software creating the individual site sheets separately on a simple digital document afterwards.</p> <p>Today, QField, thanks to its compatibility with QGIS, allows you to skip the transition from paper to digital or from different software, reducing time and costs.</p> <p>The archaeological survey (for a comprehensive account of methods of the Archaeological survey, see Cambi, Terrenato 1994, pp. 117\u2013143, and Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) must be preceded by the construction of a GIS platform that takes into consideration both the data acquired during the field survey phase and the bibliographic ones. For this reason, it will be necessary to work on two tables: one is spatial, which is useful in the field, and the other is alphanumeric. Both will be joined in a single spatial table, useful for consultation on the GIS desktop. This process is possible through the use of a relational geo-database such as SpatiaLite and PostGIS or, alternatively, through the creation of a join between the tables and the geometries.</p> <p>However, the big advantage of using a geo-database is the ability to create queries capable of merging information from two or more tables into a single table (view) (for more in-depth information on the use of GIS and Geodatabases in archaeology, see Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]).</p> <p>This process further speeds up field work by minimising the data to be stored during archaeological survey.</p> <p>The data collected in the field during the survey will be recorded and digitised through three different layers (point, line and polygon). The attribute tables connected to the three layers record the following information: Project Name (String), Municipality (String), Location (String), Feature Number (Integer), Place Name (String), Location (String), Date (Date), Site Definition (String), Visibility (String) and Photos (String).</p> <p>The attribute values, \u201cProject name\u201d and \u201cFeature Number\u201d, between the two tables must be Unique Constraint in order to identify only one unique \u201cProject name\u201d and only one \u201cFeature Number\u201d.</p> <p>The GIS platform must also have base maps such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Orthophotos and so on. In this case, we used the following maps: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. To make these maps lighter, we created first overviews (pyramids) in QGIS.</p> <p>The positioning of the archaeological features identified can be recorded through the GPS internal device. However, for a greater accuracy, QField can be connected to a GNSS antenna.</p> <p>In archaeological consultancy and archaeological risk assessment jobs, it is recommended to upload into the GIS project an infrastructure layer containing the infrastructure\u2019s geometric information, measurements and others, besides a buffer of itself.</p> <p>After setting the basics of our project on QGIS, we need to export the project through the use of the QField Sync plugin within QField. Alternatively, we can carry this out by simply copying the folder containing the project file with the * .QGIS extension, the database and the rasters (or the geopackage containing our rasters: IGM, Basemap and so on) into our smartphone or tablet.</p> <p>By default, QField creates a folder where you can save projects (Android/data/ ch.opengis.QField/files), but it is always better to store them on an external SSD, since if you were to uninstall QField from your device, all the folders and files contained in them will be removed running the risk of deleting the data.</p> <p>After we set up the bases of the GIS project in QGIS, we need to export it into QField through a suitable plug-in called QField-Sync.</p> <p>However, we can perform that task even by simply transferring (copy and paste) the QGIS project and the related dataset to our Android device.

This forces you to work with the maximum optimisation of the timing and assets, despite the fact that the weather and visibility conditions in the field are often poor (Figure 2).</p> <p> Figure 2 - An example of when the weather and visibility conditions in the field are poor. Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019.  </p> <p>Now, let us see why the use of QField facilitates the reduction of working times and, at the same time, guarantees the saving of resources to be invested in the archaeological investigation, providing a practical example of using the GIS App for Android.</p> <p>In this kind of work, the first step is to strip the area to be investigated with the use of machinery, aiming to remove the topsoil and then eventually the subsoil.</p> <p>The subsequent step involves the identification of archaeological features both directly in the field and by comparing the results of the aerial remote sensing and geophysical analysis when this type of technology is used.</p> <p>The archaeological features identified are then digitally detected by GPS or Total Station.</p> <p>Finally, all the excavation interventions that need to be completed in the investigation area (slots) are outlined, where it is more relevant in terms of understanding the stratigraphic relationship between the archaeological features identified.</p> <p>This phase of the work is called \u201cPre-Ex\u201d.</p> <p>The Pre-Ex survey will be the topographical base for the creation of the GIS platform of the project in QGIS, together with the base map of the area, the TBM\u2019s and any aerial orthophotos of the site. Within the same platform, we will also upload a geodatabase containing the layers necessary for the digitisation of the following:</p> <p>a. The archaeological features identified in the field;</p> <p>b The slots planned;</p> <p>c. The contexts investigated and their related levels;</p> <p>d. The plan and section lines used for the manual drawings;</p> <p>e. All the elements that we may need to detect during the archaeological investigation of the site.</p> <p>However, in the same database, there will also be tables related to the paperwork sheets.</p> <p>Thus, they are comparable to the digital version of the paper registers and other related paperwork that are commonly used on construction sites for excavation documentation.</p> <p>This database (what comes next is just an example of database structure. Tables and geometries can be different according to the characteristics of the sites and the topology of investigations that must be carried out. In any case, tables and vectors must be related to each other in order to interact. QField recognises the project relations set in QGIS.) is made of:</p> <ol> <li>Sites (Vector): Contains the list and description of all the sites on which the company is working.</li> <li>Context_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the contexts identified and excavated during the excavation project.</li> <li>Slots (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the slots excavated and contains the information of the paper slot register.</li> <li>Level_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the levels taken during the excavation of each slot.</li> <li>Drawings_Vector (Vector): This layer graphically represents the plan and section lines used for the manual drawings.</li> <li>Drawing_Point (Vector): This layer graphically represents the points through which the plan and section lines pass.</li> <li>Context_Register (No geometry): digital register, which contains all the investigated contexts.</li> <li>Drawings_Register (No geometry): digital register of all the drawings.</li> <li>Permatrace_Register (No geometry): digital register of the permatrace sheets.</li> <li>Sample_Register (No geometry): digital register of the samples collected.</li> <li>Photo_Register (No geometry): digital register of all photos taken.</li> <li>Small_Find_Register (No geometry): digital register of all small finds collected.</li> <li>Finds_Bag_Register (No geometry): digital register of all finds bags collected during the excavation.</li> <li>Context_Sheets (No geometry): This layer is the digital version of the context sheets register and contains all the information related to each context investigated.</li> </ol> <p>At this point, we need to simply transfer the master project created in QGIS with all the \u201cproject relation\u201d and \u201cwidgets\u201d to the tablet or the smartphone and manage it directly on site with QField to immediately appreciate its advantages and convenience (Figure 3).</p> <p> Figure 3 - An example of the same open area excavation GIS platform project in QGIS (above) and in QField (below). Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019.  </p> <p>In fact, primarily, by using this system, archaeologists who are working in the field will be able to directly register the context numbers identified during the excavation within QField, in the appropriate \u201ccontext register\u201d table in the QField database.</p> <p>This aspect already speeds up on-site operations by saving the time generally taken to go back and forth from the site to the compound or from the site to the car/van and vice versa, for the compilation of paper registers; especially, if we take into consideration the fact that, on a regular basis, cars and compounds are located at a considerable distance away from the excavation area.</p> <p>Additionally, since generally there is only one device on site and this is usually held by the site manager or by the supervisors, this would make it easier for them to check that the field archaeologists are assigning the right numbers to the identified contexts.</p> <p>Very often, on a location tend to become confused, especially when the excavation area of the site is poor due to adverse weather conditions. Along with the above issues, they can also encounter errors such as registering the same feature with different cut numbers or by assigning the same context numbers to different features.</p> <p>This occurs even more frequently when the field team is composed of numerous archaeologists who work in separate excavation slots from each other. These slots can be spread around the excavation area, making interaction and communication between them more challenging.</p> <p>This issue is also linked to another problem, which means, for those who work in the field, it is impossible to have a constant overview of the investigation area and the archaeological features identified, which often causes confusion and making mistakes during the registration of the context numbers.</p> <p>Therefore, from this point of view, QField represents a real breakthrough by giving the following possibilities to the people working on site, at any time:</p> <p>i. To have a general overview of the excavation area;</p> <p>ii. To query the surveyed archaeological features;</p> <p>iii. To check the shape and the orientation of the archaeological features identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which must be dug even when the site conditions are poor.</p> <p>QField aids with various challenges encountered in the field: time wasted due to inclement, wet weather and perpetually sodden and muddy soil churned up by people and vehicles continually accessing the site. These cause the identified archaeological features to become unrecognisable after several days of the site being stripped (Figure 2).</p> <p>By using the device\u2019s GPS, as it allows the user to navigate within the excavation area and to find, albeit with a certain margin of error, the archaeological features that need to be excavated, even when the visibility on site is poor.</p> <p>Similarly, by doing so, when visibility conditions are bad, it is easier to centre with the slots in the archaeological features that have previously been identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which prevents the miscalculation of digging into the natural sites.</p> <p>A typical example of this is when there are furrows running across the field, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see their entire length with the naked eye.</p> <p>Typically, in order to remedy this type of problem, archaeologists use printed maps in the excavation area; however, although this can certainly be a help, in practice, they are in no way comparable to the convenience of digital maps and consequently to QField for a number of reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Printed maps deteriorate very quickly due to wind, humidity and especially when handled by human hands.</li> <li>To contain the entire excavation area, they must often be printed in very large formats, which requires particular plotters, which incurs considerable costs and makes them difficult to use.</li> <li>Paper maps are not interactive, which means that you cannot ask them questions.</li> <li>They do not solve the problem of having to precisely centre the archaeological features, which need to be investigated with the slots when the visibility conditions on the site are poor.</li> </ol> <p>Notably, the use of QField on site simplifies the workload of managers and supervisors in the planning of the excavation interventions, allowing them to easily instruct field archaeologists directly in the excavation area. By doing so, they will be able to train the field team efficiently with accurate information regarding the features that they will have to dig, supporting their explanation with the graphic aid of the tablet and with details related to what has already been investigated and uploaded into the database of the project.</p> <p>Apart from the fieldwork, QField makes the job easier for archaeologists even in the recording phase, simplifying their work in the production of the paperwork. As we already mentioned, they can continuously query the tablet to obtain the necessary information that needs to be included in their paper documentation sheets, such as the section or plan numbers of the contexts that they have excavated, along with the photo numbers of the same contexts, or any other related information.</p> <p>Furthermore, it will be much easier for them to draw the location plans that are generally required in the context sheets, as they will have much more pieces of information available to provide an interpretation of what they have dug.</p> <p>Another very important aspect to take into consideration when working with QField is that there is a possibility of completely removing the manual registration process of the slot numbers, context numbers, drawing numbers, sample numbers, photo numbers and so on. Simultaneously, by using this system, we can also avoid issues such as:</p> <ol> <li>The manual data-entry of the paper registers into the database of the project;</li> <li>The problem of deciphering incomprehensible calligraphies, which greatly increase the possibility of making transcription mistakes.</li> </ol> <p>In fact, unclear calligraphies are a recurring problem related to the manual recording of the excavation documentation and in particular of the registers. This is also going to affect the accuracy of the information that must be put into the database during computerisation.</p> <p>Additionally, the archaeologist involved in the paperwork must include in his documentation context numbers, drawing numbers and other types of information related to the archaeological features and in relation to his own, which have been excavated and recorded by other colleagues. In this circumstance, to confuse one number for another, perhaps due to the unclear handwriting of the colleague, is a very common mistake.</p> <p>Worst-case scenario means that:</p> <ol> <li>There will no longer be a match between digital registers of the database and paper registers;</li> <li>The information on various context sheets will not be reliable;</li> <li>Both cases (as mentioned above).</li> </ol> <p>Therefore, we will have to spend a lot of time and effort tracking down the error and correcting it.</p> <p>Instead, the use of a digital recording eliminates this problem and facilitates the checking of errors.</p> <p>The main benefit of the GIS tools is that they enable us to query the features by giving us the possibility to cross-check data, which speeds up the checking process.</p> <p>To give a practical example, if you need to adjust the number of a context, or a drawing or anything else within a digital register by a number, with the QGIS \u201cfield calculator\u201d, it becomes an easy task taking only a few seconds.</p> <p>Just think how long it would take to perform the same task using registers and paperonly documentation, especially when working with considerable amounts of data collected within an extensive excavation.</p> <p>In this case, you must first trace the folder containing the numerical series of the number to be revised, then browse one-by-one all the registers until you find the number that needs to be amended and finally corrected, along with all the subsequent numbers. This will not only need to be corrected in the registers, but also within the specific sections of the context sheets.</p> <p>In other words, if a context, drawing or photo number has been registered incorrectly, it is not enough to correct only the register but also all the paperwork that relates to the number that has been mentioned.</p> <p>Therefore, by using a digital register (table), the operation will only take a few minutes; however, if you were working on the paper documentation by hand, it could take numerous hours of hard work.</p> <p>One final significantly important aspect to take into consideration is the saving of paper and consequently the amount of money involved. The use of QField and digital documentation allows us to efficiently manage the excavation data. By working in this way, it is no longer necessary to print out the survey plans, the registers and the paperwork sheets.</p> <p>However, if the competent authority (county archaeology) or the customer explicitly requests a paper version of all the documentation produced on site, it will be possible to print out everything at the end of the project, only once all of the amendments have been made. This helps to avoid unnecessary waste of paper, along with all the other problems that were previously mentioned.</p> <p>Even in this case, the QGIS \u201cprint composer\u201d allows us to develop customised layouts that can be saved and used at any time.</p>","title":"5. Working with QField in an Open Area Excavation"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#6-conclusions","text":"<p>In an increasingly digital world, it is unacceptable to continue working on paper especially because, at the end of the process, all paper documentation must be digitised for archiving needs. Today, in fact, both the museums and the warehouses of the archaeological companies have less space available for the storage of paper folders. At this point, it would be beneficial to manage the data in a digital format at the beginning of the excavation process, immediately saving time and resources.</p> <p>Scanning the PDF documents of registers, context sheets and, in general, all documentation produced on site is not a practical and sustainable solution. As previously mentioned, often, this documentation in extensive excavation projects is made up of thousands of paperwork sheets; I challenge anyone to reconstruct an excavation matrix by checking all the stratigraphic reports on the paperwork PDF scan. This kind of job forces you to continually scroll up and down the PDF document in search of the relationships between the various contexts, resulting in a significant waste of time and energy; without any regards to the costs that are involved when scanning in thousands of sheets.</p> <p>Archaeological excavations are constantly driven by strict and increasingly shorter deadlines. The use of GIS for the management of excavation data can no longer be ignored. Currently, the possibility of an \u201cOpen Source\u201d and a \u201cpocket\u201d GIS platform, such as QField, truly represents a unique opportunity to make the work of archaeologists on site easier, faster and more accurate.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, it is much easier to build the matrix and compile the phasing of the archaeological features identified working with a digital system during the Post-Ex phase. Thus, only an instrument such as GIS, which gives us the possibility of launching queries and continuously cross-referencing data, allows us to perform this type of work quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>At the same time, the GIS allows us to have a continuous overview of the data produced on site and to further implement information regarding the investigation by using geospatial analysis, which helps to facilitate the final interpretative reconstruction.</p> <p>In short, the principle of paper lasting forever cannot be accepted any more. Primarily, because it is not true, and secondly, it deteriorates over time, especially when, as in most cases, it is kept in the basements of archives, museums or sites of archaeological companies.</p> <p>In addition, paper documents entail enormous logistical difficulties in terms of sharing and consulting data, in comparison to digital documentation, which can be easily shared.</p> <p>R.M.</p> <p>Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>Informed Consent Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>References</p> <ol> <li>Cambi, F.; Terrenato, N.

The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected. This information is being used by MAFF on Vava'u for agricultural planning and decision making.</p> <p>Extension officers were trained to use QField at MAFF's trial plantation. Following training, a team of seven extension officers conducted the survey of vanilla plantations. In total, 140 vanilla plantations were surveyed. The survey data was processed and visualised using QGIS and a Shiny dashboard application. QField enabled MAFF staff to view reference layers of farm boundaries on mobile devices in the field and map the extent of vanilla plantations within each farm. Maps of the vanilla plantations and summary statistics reporting the number of vanilla plantations, total area surveyed, and the estimated yield for plantations were produced.</p> <p>Capturing this information using QField enabled MAFF to identify that large areas under vanilla cultivation were in a neglected management condition. This data, and the insights generated from it, were used for reporting at the national level and presentations to senior ministry staff at the MAFF headquarters on Tongatapu in July 2020. Following the vanilla survey, there are plans to train MAFF extension staff based on the main island (Tongatapu) and other island groups to use QField for crop and farm surveys. The MAFF team in Vava'u are currently using QField to map areas cultivated by grower groups, the different crops under cultivation, and problems farmers are facing with cultivation in all districts on the island. The government is using this information as part of a process to monitor and evaluate allocated funds that support farming initiatives and the food security program of the Government.</p>","title":"Vanilla Surveys using QField"},{"location":"success-stories/vanilla-survey/#acknowledgements","text":"<p>The project was funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR; ASEM/2016/101).</p> <p>   </p> <p>   </p> <p> Extension Officers, Tangaki Aloua and Selimoti Fetokai, looking for the exact location of the vanilla plantation before the plot survey.  </p> <p> Entering attribute data into QField such as number of vanilla plants and block sheet and lot number which identify land parcels.  </p> <p>   </p>   <ol> <li> <p>Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Food, and Fisheries, Government of Tonga\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>UWA School of Agriculture and Environment, The University of Western Australia\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Geography and Planning, The University of Western Australia\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","title":"Acknowledgements"},{"location":"de/get-started/concepts/","text":"<p>Die Entwicklung von QField erfolgte unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung von verschiedenen Grundideen.</p>","title":"Grundidee"},{"location":"de/get-started/concepts/#halte-es-einfach","text":"<p>Die Anforderungen im Feld sind nicht dieselben wie am Schreibtisch.

The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected. This information is being used by MAFF on Vava'u for agricultural planning and decision making.</p> <p>Extension officers were trained to use QField at MAFF's trial plantation. Following training, a team of seven extension officers conducted the survey of vanilla plantations. In total, 140 vanilla plantations were surveyed. The survey data was processed and visualised using QGIS and a Shiny dashboard application. QField enabled MAFF staff to view reference layers of farm boundaries on mobile devices in the field and map the extent of vanilla plantations within each farm. Maps of the vanilla plantations and summary statistics reporting the number of vanilla plantations, total area surveyed, and the estimated yield for plantations were produced.</p> <p>Capturing this information using QField enabled MAFF to identify that large areas under vanilla cultivation were in a neglected management condition. This data, and the insights generated from it, were used for reporting at the national level and presentations to senior ministry staff at the MAFF headquarters on Tongatapu in July 2020. Following the vanilla survey, there are plans to train MAFF extension staff based on the main island (Tongatapu) and other island groups to use QField for crop and farm surveys. The MAFF team in Vava'u are currently using QField to map areas cultivated by grower groups, the different crops under cultivation, and problems farmers are facing with cultivation in all districts on the island. The government is using this information as part of a process to monitor and evaluate allocated funds that support farming initiatives and the food security program of the Government.</p>","title":"Mesures de la vanille \u00e0 l'aide de QField"},{"location":"fr/success-stories/vanilla-survey/#remerciements","text":"<p>The project was funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR; ASEM/2016/101).</p> <p>   </p> <p>   </p> <p> Extension Officers, Tangaki Aloua and Selimoti Fetokai, looking for the exact location of the vanilla plantation before the plot survey.  </p> <p> Entering attribute data into QField such as number of vanilla plants and block sheet and lot number which identify land parcels.  </p> <p>   </p>   <ol> <li> <p>Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Food, and Fisheries, Government of Tonga\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>UWA School of Agriculture and Environment, The University of Western Australia\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Geography and Planning, The University of Western Australia\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","title":"Remerciements"},{"location":"it/get-started/concepts/","text":"<p>QField \u00e8 stato pensato avendo in mente alcuni concetti chiave:</p>","title":"Concetti"},{"location":"it/get-started/concepts/#semplicita","text":"<p>Le esigenze sul campo non sono le stesse di quelle su un desktop.

Tali dati venivano digitalizzati in un software CAD o GIS, creando in seguito separatamente le schede dei singoli siti su un semplice documento digitale.</p> <p>Oggi, QField, grazie alla sua compatibilit\u00e0 con QGIS, ti permette di saltare il passaggio dalla carta al digitale o da software diversi, riducendo tempi e costi.</p> <p>L'indagine archeologica (per un resoconto completo dei metodi dell'indagine archeologica archeologico, si veda Cambi, Terrenato 1994, pp. 117-143, e Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) deve essere preceduta dalla costruzione di una piattaforma GIS che tenga conto sia dei dati acquisiti durante la fase di indagine sul campo sia di quelli bibliografici. Per questo motivo sar\u00e0 necessario lavorare su due tabelle: una spaziale, utile sul campo, e l'altra alfanumerica. Entrambe saranno unite in un'unica tabella spaziale, utile per la consultazione sul GIS desktop. Questo processo \u00e8 possibile grazie all'utilizzo di un geodatabase relazionale come SpatiaLite e PostGIS o, in alternativa, attraverso la creazione di un join tra le tabelle e le geometrie.</p> <p>Tuttavia, il grande vantaggio dell'utilizzo di un geodatabase \u00e8 la possibilit\u00e0 di creare query in grado di unire le informazioni provenienti da due o pi\u00f9 tabelle in un'unica tabella (vista) (per informazioni pi\u00f9 approfondite sull'uso dei GIS e dei geodatabase in archeologia, vedi Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]).</p> <p>Questo processo accelera ulteriormente il lavoro sul campo riducendo al minimo i dati da memorizzare durante l'indagine archeologica.</p> <p>I dati raccolti sul campo durante l'indagine saranno registrati e digitalizzati attraverso tre diversi layer (punto, linea e poligono). Le tabelle degli attributi collegate ai tre layer registrano le seguenti informazioni: Nome del progetto (stringa), Comune (stringa), Localit\u00e0 (stringa), Numero dell'elemento (intero), Nome del luogo (stringa), Posizione (stringa), Data (data), Definizione del sito (stringa), Visibilit\u00e0 (Stringa) e Foto (Stringa).</p> <p>I valori degli attributi, \"Nome del progetto\" e \"Numero dell'elemento\", tra le due tabelle devono essere univoci per identificare un solo \"Nome del progetto\" e un solo \"Numero dell'elemento\".</p> <p>La piattaforma GIS deve anche disporre di mappe di base come Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Ortofoto e cos\u00ec via. In questo caso abbiamo utilizzato le seguenti mappe: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. Per rendere queste mappe pi\u00f9 leggere, abbiamo creato prima panoramiche (piramidi) in QGIS.</p> <p>Il posizionamento degli elementi archeologici individuati pu\u00f2 essere registrato attraverso il GPS interno del dispositivo. Tuttavia, per una maggiore precisione, QField pu\u00f2 essere collegato a un'antenna GNSS.</p> <p>Nei lavori di consulenza archeologica e di valutazione del rischio archeologico, si consiglia di di caricare nel progetto GIS un layer di infrastruttura che contenga le informazioni geometriche, misure e altro, oltre a un buffer dell'infrastruttura stessa.</p> <p>Dopo aver impostato le basi del nostro progetto su QGIS, dobbiamo esportare il progetto attraverso l'uso del plugin QField Sync all'interno di QField. In alternativa, possiamo farlo semplicemente copiando la cartella contenente il file di progetto con estensione * .QGIS, il database e i raster (o il geopackage contenente i nostri raster: IGM, Basemap e cos\u00ec via) nel nostro smartphone o tablet.</p> <p>Per impostazione predefinita, QField crea una cartella in cui salvare i progetti (Android/data/ ch.opengis.QField/files), ma \u00e8 sempre meglio memorizzarli su un SSD esterno, dato che se dovessi disinstallare QField dal tuo dispositivo, tutte le cartelle e i file in esse contenuti saranno rimossi con il rischio di cancellare i dati.</p> <p>Dopo aver impostato le basi del progetto GIS in QGIS, \u00e8 necessario esportarlo in QField attraverso un apposito plug-in chiamato QField-Sync.</p> <p>Tuttavia, possiamo eseguire questa operazione anche semplicemente trasferendo (copia e incolla) il progetto QGIS e il relativo dataset sul nostro dispositivo Android.

Questo vale soprattutto per i siti archeologici commerciali dove molto spesso i tempi di realizzazione del lavoro e i budget a disposizione per le indagini archeologiche sono molto stretti. Questo ti costringe a lavorare con la massima ottimizzazione delle tempistiche e delle risorse, nonostante le condizioni meteorologiche e di visibilit\u00e0 sul campo siano spesso scarse (Figura 2).</p> <p> Figura 2 - Un esempio di quando le condizioni meteorologiche e di visibilit\u00e0 sul campo sono scarse.

Le tabelle e le geometrie possono essere diverse a seconda delle caratteristiche dei siti e della topologia delle indagini che devono essere svolte. In ogni caso, le tabelle e i layer devono essere in relazione tra loro per poter interagire.

Immagine di Roberto Montagnetti 2019.  </p> <p>Infatti, grazie a questo sistema, gli archeologi che lavorano sul campo saranno in grado di registrare direttamente i numeri di contesto identificati durante lo scavo all'interno di QField, nell'apposita tabella \"registro dei contesti\" del database QField.</p> <p>Questo aspetto accelera gi\u00e0 le operazioni in loco, risparmiando il tempo che generalmente si impiega per andare avanti e indietro dal cantiere alla struttura o dal cantiere all'auto/furgone e viceversa, per la compilazione dei registri cartacei; in particolare, se consideriamo il fatto che, regolarmente, le auto e le piazzole sono situate a una distanza considerevole dall'area di scavo.</p> <p>Inoltre, dato che in genere c'\u00e8 un solo dispositivo sul posto e che questo \u00e8 solitamente tenuto dal capocantiere o dai supervisori, sarebbe pi\u00f9 facile per loro controllare che gli archeologi sul campo assegnino i numeri giusti ai contesti identificati.</p> <p>Molto spesso, in un sito si tende a fare confusione, soprattutto quando l'area di scavo del sito \u00e8 scarsa a causa di condizioni meteorologiche avverse. Oltre ai problemi di cui sopra, possono anche verificarsi degli errori come la registrazione dello stesso elemento con numeri di taglio diversi o l'assegnazione dello stesso numero di contesto a elementi diversi.</p> <p>Questo accade ancora pi\u00f9 frequentemente quando il team sul campo \u00e8 composto da numerosi archeologi che lavorano in sezioni di scavo separate l'una dall'altra. Questi slot possono essere sparsi per l'area di scavo, rendendo pi\u00f9 difficile l'interazione e la comunicazione tra di loro.</p> <p>Questa questione \u00e8 legata anche a un altro problema: per chi lavora sul campo \u00e8 impossibile avere una visione d'insieme costante dell'area di indagine e degli elementi archeologici individuati, il che spesso genera confusione e fa commettere errori durante la registrazione dei numeri di contesto.</p> <p>Da questo punto di vista, quindi, QField rappresenta una vera e propria svolta in quanto offre le seguenti possibilit\u00e0 a chi lavora in cantiere, in qualsiasi momento:</p> <p>i. Avere una panoramica generale dell'area di scavo;</p> <p>ii. Interrogare gli elementi archeologici rilevati;</p> <p>iii. Verificare la forma e l'orientamento degli elementi archeologici identificati nella fase di Pre-Ex, che devono essere scavati anche quando le condizioni del sito sono precarie.</p> <p>QField aiuta a risolvere le varie sfide che si incontrano sul campo: perdite di tempo a causa di tempo inclemente e piovoso e il terreno perennemente zuppo e fangoso smosso da persone e veicoli che accedono continuamente al sito. Questi fattori fanno s\u00ec che gli elementi archeologici identificati diventino irriconoscibili dopo diversi giorni di scavo del sito (Figura 2).</p> <p>Utilizzando il GPS del dispositivo, consente all'utente di navigare all'interno dell'area di scavo e di trovare, anche se con un certo margine di errore, gli elementi archeologici da scavare, anche quando la visibilit\u00e0 sul posto \u00e8 scarsa.</p> <p>Inoltre, in questo modo, quando le condizioni di visibilit\u00e0 sono cattive, \u00e8 pi\u00f9 facile centrare gli slot degli elementi archeologici che sono stati identificati in precedenza nella fase Pre-Ex, evitando cos\u00ec di sbagliare i calcoli per scavare nei siti naturali.</p> <p>Un esempio tipico \u00e8 quando ci sono dei solchi che attraversano il campo e diventa sempre pi\u00f9 difficile vederne l'intera lunghezza a occhio nudo.</p> <p>In genere, per ovviare a questo tipo di problema, gli archeologi utilizzano mappe stampate nell'area di scavo; tuttavia, anche se questo pu\u00f2 essere certamente d'aiuto, nella pratica non sono in alcun modo paragonabili alla comodit\u00e0 delle mappe digitali e di conseguenza a QField per una serie di motivi:</p> <ol> <li>Le mappe stampate si deteriorano molto rapidamente a causa del vento, dell'umidit\u00e0 e soprattutto quando maneggiati da mani umane.</li> <li>Per contenere l'intera area di scavo, spesso devono essere stampati in formati molto grandi, che richiedono plotter particolari, che comportano costi considerevoli e che li rendono difficile da usare.</li> <li>Le mappe cartacee non sono interattive, il che significa che non puoi farci domande.</li> <li>Non risolvono il problema di dover centrare con precisione gli elementi archeologici, che devono essere studiati con gli slot quando le condizioni di visibilit\u00e0 sul sito sono scarse.</li> </ol> <p>In particolare, l'utilizzo di QField in cantiere semplifica il carico di lavoro di manager e supervisori nella pianificazione degli interventi di scavo, consentendo loro di istruire facilmente gli archeologi sul campo direttamente nell'area di scavo. In questo modo, saranno in grado di addestrare il team sul campo con informazioni accurate sugli elementi che dovranno scavare, supportando le loro spiegazioni con l'ausilio grafico del tablet e con i dettagli relativi a ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato gi\u00e0 indagato e caricato nel database del progetto.</p> <p>Oltre al lavoro sul campo, QField facilita il lavoro degli archeologi anche nella fase di registrazione, semplificando il loro lavoro nella produzione di documenti. Come abbiamo gi\u00e0 detto, possono interrogare continuamente il tablet per ottenere le informazioni necessarie che devono essere incluse nelle schede di documentazione cartacee, come ad esempio i numeri di sezione o di piano dei contesti che hanno scavato, insieme ai numeri delle foto degli stessi contesti, o qualsiasi altra informazione correlata.</p> <p>Inoltre, sar\u00e0 molto pi\u00f9 facile per loro disegnare le planimetrie di localizzazione che sono generalmente richieste nelle schede di contesto, in quanto avranno a disposizione un numero maggiore di informazioni disponibili per fornire un'interpretazione di ci\u00f2 che hanno scavato.</p> <p>Un altro aspetto molto importante da prendere in considerazione quando si lavora con QField \u00e8 che c'\u00e8 la possibilit\u00e0 di eliminare completamente il processo di registrazione manuale dei numeri di slot, numeri di contesto, numeri di estrazione, numeri di campione, numeri di foto e cos\u00ec via. Allo stesso tempo, utilizzando questo sistema, possiamo anche evitare problemi quali:</p> <ol> <li>L'inserimento manuale dei registri cartacei nel database del progetto;</li> <li>Il problema della decifrazione di calligrafie incomprensibili, che aumentano notevolmente la possibilit\u00e0 di commettere errori di trascrizione.</li> </ol> <p>Infatti, le calligrafie poco chiare sono un problema ricorrente legato alla registrazione manuale della documentazione di scavo e in particolare dei registri. Questo problema influisce anche l'accuratezza delle informazioni che devono essere inserite nel database durante l'informatizzazione.</p> <p>Inoltre, l'archeologo coinvolto nelle pratiche deve includere nella sua documentazione i numeri di contesto, i numeri di disegno e altri tipi di informazioni relative agli elementi archeologici che sono stati scavati e registrati da altri colleghi. In questa circostanza, confondere un numero con un altro, magari a causa della calligrafia poco chiara del collega, \u00e8 un errore molto comune.</p> <p>Lo scenario peggiore significa che:</p> <ol> <li>Non ci sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 corrispondenza tra i registri digitali del database e quelli cartacei;</li> <li>Le informazioni contenute nelle varie schede contestuali non saranno affidabili;</li> <li>Entrambi i casi (come gi\u00e0 detto).</li> </ol> <p>Pertanto, dovremo dedicare molto tempo e sforzi per rintracciare l'errore e correggerlo.</p> <p>L'uso di una registrazione digitale elimina invece questo problema e facilita il controllo degli errori.</p> <p>Il principale vantaggio degli strumenti GIS \u00e8 che ci permettono di interrogare gli elementi dando la possibilit\u00e0 di effettuare un controllo incrociato dei dati, velocizzando cos\u00ec il processo di verifica.</p> <p>Per fare un esempio pratico, se hai bisogno di modificare il numero di un contesto, di un disegno o di qualsiasi altra cosa all'interno di un registro digitale con un numero, con il \"calcolatore di campo\" di QGIS, diventa un compito facile che richiede solo pochi secondi.</p> <p>Pensa solo a quanto tempo ci vorrebbe per eseguire lo stesso compito utilizzando registri e documentazione solo cartacea, soprattutto quando si lavora con quantit\u00e0 considerevoli di dati raccolti in uno scavo di grandi dimensioni.</p> <p>In questo caso, devi innanzitutto rintracciare la cartella contenente la serie numerica del numero da rivedere, quindi sfogliare uno per uno tutti i registri fino a trovare il numero che deve essere modificato e infine corretto, insieme a tutti i numeri successivi. La correzione non dovr\u00e0 essere effettuata solo nei registri, ma anche all'interno delle sezioni specifiche delle schede contestuali.</p> <p>In altre parole, se un contesto, un disegno o un numero di foto \u00e8 stato registrato in modo errato, non \u00e8 sufficiente correggere solo il registro, ma anche tutti i documenti che si riferiscono al numero che \u00e8 stato citato.</p> <p>Pertanto, utilizzando un registro digitale (tabella), l'operazione richieder\u00e0 solo pochi minuti; Tuttavia, se si lavora a mano sulla documentazione cartacea, potrebbero essere necessarie numerose ore di lavoro.</p> <p>Un ultimo aspetto molto importante da tenere in considerazione \u00e8 il risparmio di carta e, di conseguenza, di denaro.

Oggi, infatti, sia i musei che i magazzini delle aziende archeologiche hanno meno spazio a disposizione per l'archiviazione dei faldoni cartacei. A questo punto, sarebbe sarebbe vantaggioso gestire i dati in formato digitale all'inizio del processo di scavo, risparmiando tempo e risorse.</p> <p>La scansione dei documenti PDF dei registri, delle schede contestuali e, in generale, di tutta la documentazione prodotta in loco non \u00e8 una soluzione pratica e sostenibile.

Questo tipo di lavoro costringe a scorrere continuamente su e gi\u00f9 per il documento PDF alla ricerca delle relazioni tra i vari contesti, con un notevole spreco di tempo e di energie; senza considerare i costi che comporta la scansione di migliaia di fogli.</p> <p>Gli scavi archeologici sono costantemente guidati da scadenze rigide e sempre pi\u00f9 brevi.

Sono state prodotte mappe delle piantagioni di vaniglia e le statistiche riassuntive che riportano il numero di piantagioni di vaniglia, l'area totale rilevata e la resa stimata delle piantagioni.</p> <p>L'acquisizione di queste informazioni tramite QField ha permesso al MAFF di identificare che vaste aree coltivate a vaniglia si trovavano in condizioni di gestione trascurata. Questi dati, e gli approfondimenti che ne sono scaturiti, sono stati utilizzati per per la stesura di rapporti a livello nazionale e per le presentazioni ai vertici del ministero presso la sede del MAFF a Tongatapu nel luglio 2020. A seguito del sondaggio sulla vaniglia, \u00e8 prevista la formazione del personale addetto del MAFF con sede sull'isola principale (Tongatapu) e di altri gruppi di isole per l'utilizzo di QField per le indagini sulle indagini sulle colture e sulle aziende agricole. Il team del MAFF di Vava'u sta attualmente utilizzando QField per mappare le aree coltivate dai gruppi di coltivatori, le diverse coltivazioni e i problemi che gli agricoltori incontrano nella coltivazione in tutti i distretti dell'isola. Il governo sta utilizzando queste informazioni come parte di un processo di monitoraggio e valutazione dei fondi stanziati a sostegno delle iniziative agricole e il programma di sicurezza alimentare del governo.</p>","title":"Indagine delle piantagioni di vaniglia con QField"},{"location":"it/success-stories/vanilla-survey/#riconoscimenti","text":"<p>Il progetto \u00e8 stato finanziato dal Centro australiano per la ricerca agricola internazionale (ACIAR; ASEM/2016/101).</p> <p>   </p> <p>   </p> <p> I funzionari, Tangaki Aloua e Selimoti Fetokai, alla ricerca della esatta posizione della piantagione di vaniglia prima del sondaggio. di studio.  </p> <p> Inserimento di attributi in QField come il numero di piante di vaniglia e il numero di blocco e di lotto che identificano le parcelle  </p> <p>   </p>   <ol> <li> <p>Ministero dell'Agricoltura, delle Foreste, dell'Alimentazione e della Pesca, Governo di Tonga\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>UWA School of Agriculture and Environment, Universit\u00e0 dell'Australia Occidentale\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Geografia e Pianificazione, Universit\u00e0 dell'Australia Occidentale\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","title":"Riconoscimenti"},{"location":"es/get-started/concepts/","text":"<p>QField fue dise\u00f1ado con unos pocos conceptos clave en mente.</p>","title":"Conceptos"},{"location":"es/get-started/concepts/#mantenerlo-simple","text":"<p>Los requisitos en el campo no son los mismos que en el escritorio.

Por esta raz\u00f3n, ser\u00e1 necesario trabajar en dos tablas: una es espacial, que es \u00fatil en el campo, y la otra es alfanum\u00e9rica. Ambas se unir\u00e1n en una \u00fanica tabla espacial, \u00fatil para la consulta en el SIG de escritorio.

En En este caso, no podemos tener una buena precisi\u00f3n en el registro de nuestros rasgos arqueol\u00f3gicos utilizando el GNSS. Al mismo tiempo, no podr\u00edamos cargar servicios WMS como Google Satellite, Open Street Map y otros. Otra desventaja est\u00e1 relacionada con la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda: mantener la pantalla, la conexi\u00f3n de datos y el GPS siempre activos reducir\u00e1 dr\u00e1sticamente la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda de nuestro dispositivo, aunque podamos llevar con nosotros bater\u00edas port\u00e1tiles.

Imagen por Roberto Montagnetti 2019.  </p> <p>De hecho, principalmente, al utilizar este sistema, los arque\u00f3logos que trabajan sobre el terreno podr\u00e1n registrar directamente los n\u00fameros de contexto identificados durante la excavaci\u00f3n dentro de QField, en la correspondiente tabla de \"registro de contexto\" de la base de datos QField.</p> <p>Este aspecto ya agiliza las operaciones in situ al ahorrar el tiempo que generalmente se tarda en de ir y venir del lugar al recinto o del lugar al coche/furgoneta y viceversa, para para elaborar los registros en papel, sobre todo si se tiene en cuenta que los coches y los recintos se encuentran a una distancia considerable de la zona de excavaci\u00f3n.</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s, como generalmente s\u00f3lo hay un dispositivo en el sitio y \u00e9ste suele estar en manos de el director del yacimiento o los supervisores, esto les facilitar\u00eda la comprobaci\u00f3n de que los arque\u00f3logos de campo asignan los n\u00fameros correctos a los contextos identificados.</p> <p>Muy a menudo, en un lugar tienden a confundirse, especialmente cuando la zona de excavaci\u00f3n del lugar es pobre debido a condiciones meteorol\u00f3gicas adversas. Junto con los problemas anteriores, tambi\u00e9n pueden encontrarse errores como registrar el mismo rasgo con diferentes n\u00fameros de corte o asignar los mismos n\u00fameros de contexto a objetos espaciales diferentes.</p> <p>Esto ocurre a\u00fan m\u00e1s frecuentemente cuando el equipo de campo est\u00e1 compuesto por numerosos arque\u00f3logos que trabajan en franjas de excavaci\u00f3n separadas entre s\u00ed. Estas franjas pueden estar esparcidas alrededor del \u00e1rea de excavaci\u00f3n, lo que dificulta la interacci\u00f3n y la comunicaci\u00f3n entre ellos.</p> <p>Esta cuesti\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 relacionada con otro problema, que hace que, para los que trabajan en de campo, es imposible tener una visi\u00f3n general constante de la zona de investigaci\u00f3n y de los objetos espaciales arqueol\u00f3gicos identificados, lo que a menudo provoca confusi\u00f3n y errores durante el registro de los n\u00fameros de contexto.</p> <p>Por lo tanto, desde este punto de vista, QField representa un verdadero avance al dar las siguientes posibilidades a las personas que trabajan in situ, en cualquier momento:</p> <p>i. Tener una visi\u00f3n general de la zona de excavaci\u00f3n;</p> <p>ii. Consultar los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos estudiados;</p> <p>iii. Comprobar la forma y la orientaci\u00f3n de los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos identificados en la fase Pre-Ex, que deben ser excavados incluso cuando las condiciones del lugar son malas.</p> <p>QField ayuda a superar los diversos retos que se presentan en el campo: el tiempo perdido por el tiempo inclemente y h\u00famedo, y el suelo siempre empapado y embarrado por la gente y los veh\u00edculos que acceden continuamente al lugar. Esto hace que los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos identificados se vuelvan irreconocibles despu\u00e9s de varios d\u00edas de haber sido despojados del yacimiento (Figura 2).</p> <p>Utilizando el GPS del dispositivo, ya que permite al usuario navegar dentro del \u00e1rea de excavaci\u00f3n y encontrar, aunque con un cierto margen de error, los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos que hay que excavar, incluso cuando la visibilidad en el lugar es escasa.</p> <p>Asimismo, al hacerlo, cuando las condiciones de visibilidad son malas, es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil centrarse con las aberturas en los objetos arqueol\u00f3gicos que se han identificado previamente en la fase Pre-Ex fase, lo que evita el error de c\u00e1lculo de la excavaci\u00f3n en los lugares naturales.</p> <p>Un ejemplo t\u00edpico de esto es cuando hay surcos que atraviesan el campo, y cada vez es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil ver toda su longitud a simple vista.</p> <p>Normalmente, para remediar este tipo de problemas, los arque\u00f3logos utilizan mapas impresos de la zona de excavaci\u00f3n; sin embargo, aunque esto puede ser ciertamente una ayuda, en la pr\u00e1ctica, no son de ninguna manera tan convenientes como los mapas digitales y, por tanto, de QField, por una serie de razones:</p> <ol> <li>Los mapas impresos se deterioran muy r\u00e1pidamente debido al viento, la humedad y especialmente cuando son manipulados por manos humanas.</li> <li>Para contener toda la zona de excavaci\u00f3n, a menudo deben imprimirse en formatos muy grandes, que requiere trazadores particulares, lo que supone un coste considerable y los hace dificultoso de usar.</li> <li>Los mapas en papel no son interactivos, lo que significa que no puede hacerles preguntas.</li> <li>No resuelven el problema de tener que centrar con precisi\u00f3n los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos, que deben ser investigados con las ranuras cuando las condiciones de visibilidad en el sitio son paup\u00e9rrimos.</li> </ol> <p>En particular, el uso de QField en la obra simplifica la carga de trabajo de los directores y supervisores en la planificaci\u00f3n de las intervenciones de excavaci\u00f3n, permiti\u00e9ndoles instruir f\u00e1cilmente a los arque\u00f3logos de campo directamente en la zona de excavaci\u00f3n. De este modo, podr\u00e1n formar al equipo de campo con informaci\u00f3n precisa sobre los elementos que tendr\u00e1n que excavar, apoyando su explicaci\u00f3n con la ayuda gr\u00e1fica de la tableta y con detalles relacionados con lo que ya se ha investigado y cargado en la base de datos del proyecto.</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s del trabajo de campo, QField facilita el trabajo de los arque\u00f3logos incluso en la fase de registro, simplificando su trabajo en la elaboraci\u00f3n de la documentaci\u00f3n. Como ya hemos mencionado, pueden consultar continuamente la tableta para obtener la informaci\u00f3n necesaria para incluirla en sus hojas de documentaci\u00f3n en papel, como los n\u00fameros de secci\u00f3n o de plano de los contextos que han excavado, junto con los n\u00fameros de las fotos de los mismos contextos, o cualquier otra informaci\u00f3n relacionada.</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s, les resultar\u00e1 mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil dibujar los planos de situaci\u00f3n que se que generalmente se exigen en las hojas de contexto, ya que dispondr\u00e1n de mucha m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n para interpretar lo que han excavado.</p> <p>Otro aspecto muy importante a tener en cuenta cuando se trabaja con QField es que existe la posibilidad de eliminar por completo el proceso de registro manual de los n\u00fameros de abertura, n\u00fameros de contexto, n\u00fameros de dibujo, n\u00fameros de muestra, n\u00fameros de foto y etc. Simult\u00e1neamente, al utilizar este sistema, tambi\u00e9n podemos evitar cuestiones como:</p> <ol> <li>La introducci\u00f3n manual de los registros en papel en la base de datos del proyecto;</li> <li>El problema de descifrar caligraf\u00edas incomprensibles, que aumentan enormemente la posibilidad de cometer errores de transcripci\u00f3n.</li> </ol> <p>De hecho, las caligraf\u00edas poco claras son un problema recurrente relacionado con el registro manual de la documentaci\u00f3n de las excavaciones y, en particular, de los registros. Esto tambi\u00e9n va a afectar la exactitud de la informaci\u00f3n que debe introducirse en la base de datos durante la informatizaci\u00f3n.</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s, el arque\u00f3logo que intervenga en los tr\u00e1mites debe incluir en su documentaci\u00f3n n\u00fameros de contexto, n\u00fameros de dibujo y otros tipos de informaci\u00f3n relacionados con los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos y en relaci\u00f3n con los suyos, que han sido excavados y registrados por otros colegas. En esta circunstancia, confundir un n\u00famero por otro tal vez debido a la letra poco clara del colega, es un error muy com\u00fan.</p> <p>El peor de los casos significa que:</p> <ol> <li>Ya no habr\u00e1 coincidencia entre los registros digitales de la base de datos y el papel registros;</li> <li>La informaci\u00f3n que figura en varias hojas de contexto no ser\u00e1 fiable;</li> <li>En ambos casos (como se ha mencionado anteriormente).</li> </ol> <p>Por lo tanto, tendremos que dedicar mucho tiempo y esfuerzo a rastrear el error y corregirlo.</p> <p>En cambio, el uso de una grabaci\u00f3n digital elimina este problema y facilita la comprobaci\u00f3n de los errores.</p> <p>La principal ventaja de las herramientas del SIG es que nos permiten consultar los objetos d\u00e1ndonos la posibilidad de cruzar los datos, lo que acelera el proceso de comprobaci\u00f3n.</p> <p>Por poner un ejemplo pr\u00e1ctico, si necesita ajustar el n\u00famero de un contexto, o un dibujo o cualquier otra cosa dentro de un registro digital por un n\u00famero, con la \"calculadora de campo\" de QGIS, se convierte en una tarea f\u00e1cil que s\u00f3lo lleva unos segundos.</p> <p>Piense en el tiempo que le llevar\u00eda realizar la misma tarea utilizando registros y documentaci\u00f3n en papel, especialmente cuando se trabaja con cantidades considerables de datos recogidos en una excavaci\u00f3n de gran envergadura.</p> <p>En este caso, primero debe rastrear la carpeta que contiene la serie num\u00e9rica del n\u00famero que hay que revisar, y luego recorrer uno a uno todos los registros hasta encontrar el n\u00famero que hay que modificar y finalmente corregir, junto con todos los n\u00fameros posteriores. No s\u00f3lo habr\u00e1 que corregirlo en los registros, sino tambi\u00e9n en las secciones espec\u00edficas de las hojas de contexto.</p> <p>En otras palabras, si un contexto, un dibujo o un n\u00famero de foto se ha registrado incorrectamente no basta con corregir s\u00f3lo el registro, sino tambi\u00e9n toda la documentaci\u00f3n relacionada con el n\u00famero que se ha mencionado.</p> <p>Por lo tanto, al utilizar un registro digital (tabla), la operaci\u00f3n s\u00f3lo le llevar\u00e1 unos minutos; sin embargo, si se trabajara en la documentaci\u00f3n en papel a mano, podr\u00eda llevar numerosas horas de trabajo.</p> <p>Un \u00faltimo aspecto significativamente importante a tener en cuenta es el ahorro de papel y, en consecuencia, la cantidad de dinero que supone. El uso de QField y la documentaci\u00f3n nos permite gestionar eficazmente los datos de las excavaciones. Al trabajar de este modo, ya no es necesario imprimir los planos de prospecci\u00f3n, los registros y las hojas de papeleo.</p> <p>No obstante, si la autoridad competente (arqueolog\u00eda comarcal) o el cliente solicitan expl\u00edcitamente una versi\u00f3n en papel de toda la documentaci\u00f3n elaborada in situ, ser\u00e1 posible imprimir todo al final del proyecto, s\u00f3lo una vez que se hayan realizado todas las modificaciones. Esto ayuda a evitar el desperdicio innecesario de papel, junto con todos los dem\u00e1s problemas que se han mencionado anteriormente.</p> <p>Incluso en este caso, el \"compositor de impresi\u00f3n\" de QGIS nos permite desarrollar dise\u00f1os personalizados que se pueden guardar y utilizar en cualquier momento.</p>","title":"5.

Este tipo de trabajo obliga a desplazarse continuamente hacia arriba y hacia abajo por el documento PDF en busca de las relaciones entre los distintos contextos, lo que supone una importante p\u00e9rdida de tiempo y energ\u00eda; sin ninguna consideraci\u00f3n a los costes que supone el escaneo de miles de hojas.</p> <p>Las excavaciones arqueol\u00f3gicas se ven constantemente impulsadas por plazos estrictos y cada vez m\u00e1s cortos plazos.
